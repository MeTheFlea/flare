#Build Instructions
##Prerequisites
- [GLFW 3.1.1](http://www.glfw.org/)
- [Premake 5](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki)

##Building
1. Place the GLFW 3.1.1 libs inside `extern/lib/[Debug/OptimisedDebug/Release]`.
2. Run `premake5` with the appropriate action depending on what you want to compile the project with.
	So for example, running `premake5 vs2012` will generate a Visual Studio 2012 .sln file inside `_project/vs2012` which you can then open and compile as usual. Other options include `gmake` and `vs2013`. Please refer to the [Premake 5 wiki](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki) for more build options.
